![Screenshot](./assets/images/wp-githuber-md-cover.png)

An all-in-on [WordPress Markdown Plugin](https://terryl.in/en/repository/wordpress-markdown-plugin-githuber-md/) provides a variety of features such as Markdown editor, live-preview, image-paste, HTML-to-Markdown helper, and more..

## How it works

1. WP Githuber MD will save your Markdown content into `wp_posts`.`post_content_filtered`.
2. Parse the Markdown to HTML, save the parsed HTML content into `wp_posts`.`post_content`.

This plugin will detect your Markdown content and decide what scripts will be loaded, to avoid loading unnecessary scripts.
For example, if you enabled `syntax highlight`, you have to update your post again to take effects.

## Demo

## Suggestions

The better situation to use this plugin is you just started a new blog.

If you're planning to use this plugin in an existing blog, be sure to:

- Turn off other Markdown plugins, because the similar plugins might do the same things when submitting your posts, may have some syntax conversion issues between Markdown and HTML.
- My personal suggestion is to turn off `revision` and `auto-save`, there are options in setting page.

### Detecting Language on Past Posts

Already using markdown on past posts and need to rerun the detection logic? Create this file `detect_languages.php` in your WordPress root.

```php
<?php
define('WP_USE_THEMES', false);
require('./wp-load.php');

function detect_all_post_languages() {
    $markdown_detector = new Githuber\Controller\Markdown();

    // Query all posts
    $args = array(
        'post_type' => 'post',
        'post_status' => 'publish',
        'posts_per_page' => -1
    );
    $posts_query = new WP_Query($args);

    // Loop through all posts and apply the detect_code_languages function
    if ($posts_query->have_posts()) {
        while ($posts_query->have_posts()) {
            $posts_query->the_post();
            $post_id = get_the_ID();
            $content = get_the_content();

            $markdown_detector->detect_code_languages($post_id, $content);
        }
        wp_reset_postdata();
    }
}

detect_all_post_languages();
```

Then run it from the command line:

```shell
wp eval-file detect_languages.php
```
